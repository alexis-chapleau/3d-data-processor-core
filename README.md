# 3d-data-processor-core
foundational backbone of our 3D data processing system. It contains a collection of high-performance C++ classes designed to handle complex 3D processing tasks. Leveraging the command pattern, each processing class encapsulates its algorithm within an execute method, facilitating flexible and scalable execution of 3D processing algorithms.
